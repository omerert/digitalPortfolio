    <h2> Plans</h2>
    <h3>Last week, I started making the new icons. While I finished making them, I did not add them to the home bar. So this week, I plan on scaling the images and adding them to the homebar. I will do this my using special softwares to scale the icons to the perfect size and will change our current code from using system images to our specially made icons. Because these icons will make our application more visually appealing but not a current necessity, it will be a moderate prority. To help out our our QA's, I will have a few icon sizes for them to test out, helping them save time when testing. </h3>

    <h2> Plans</h2>
    <h3>I plan to update the icons used in our app. Our old icon did not match with the theme of our app, so I will replace them with a more modern looking icon. I will do this by making a new icon and make sure that it is properly scaled to our application. I will also test it to make sure that everything works out properly. As we are finishing up our application, we are making sure to polish our application in any way possible, so this commit is moderatly prioritized.</h3>

    <h3>I will work on the APITestFile, which will test if each of the API's function properly. I will do this by creating a new file and test each of our API's. By doing this, it will help my group have less errors with other files that use API's.</h3>

    <h3>Some technical Challenges that we are facing are how to implement our project into reality. Of course, while we do have our ideas and strategy on how to execute our ISP into reality, it won’t be as easy as it seems. First of all, we need to learn and get proficient with programming in Swift since our ISP will be an app. We need to learn how to program an app, make it visually appealing, work properly, and upload it on the app store. We will need to use a lot of resources to learn how to use all of these technical mechanics. Second of all, a lot of us are used to using Microsoft and programming languages other than Swift. We will have to make a change to get used to Apple and programming in Swift. Those of us that do not have Apple products like iPhone or a Macbook will need to work on another part of the project that does not require them to make a change that will result in them spending money. Even with these barriers, it does not prevent us from succeeding. All of these technical problems do seem overwhelming at first, we as a group will overcome them. We will make sure that we can learn how to proficiently program in Swift and how to create an app in order to succeed.glob</h3>
    <h2> Scheduling Challenges </h2>
    <h3>Some scheduling challenges that we’ve encountered are class loads and extracurricular. Some of our group members take multiple rigorous classes that require them to use up a lot of their time. As a result, they would not have much time to save for the ISP and would be left out because they cannot catch up. Another problem is that our group is split between A and B days. To solve these issues, we can split the ISP so that scheduling issues would rise up.

    <h1> Roles </h1>
    
    <h2> (software) Development Engineer </h2>
    <h3> A software development engineer is responsible for designing, testing, and maintaining software systems that meet the needs of users. They work on various aspects of the software development process, including coding, debugging, and quality assurance. They may also collaborate with other team members, such as project managers, designers, and business analysts, to ensure that the software being developed is effective, efficient, and meets the goals of the project. Ultimately, the primary goal of a software development engineer is to create high-quality software that meets the needs of users and helps organizations achieve their objectives. I might not be the best fit for this role since my understanding of Swift is not the highest. </h3>
    <h2> QA Engineer </h2>
    <h3> A QA, also known as quality assurance, engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software being developed meets the necessary standards of quality: designing and implementing testing procedures, executing tests, and identifying and tracking defects. QA engineers work closely with software development engineers to identify and resolve defects and improve the overall quality of the software. They may also be responsible for creating and maintaining documentation related to the testing process, such as test plans and bug reports. I might be a good fit for this role since, in my own projects, I am able to identify how I can make my project better by running realistic test. </h3>
    <h2> Project Manager </h2>
    <h3> A project manager is responsible for:  planning, organizing, and directing the work of a team to achieve a specific goal. This includes establishing project goals and objectives, creating project plans, and defining roles and responsibilities for team members. Project managers also play a key role in budgeting and resource allocation, and may be responsible for tracking and reporting on project progress to stakeholders. They may work with a variety of team members, including developers, designers, and business analysts, to ensure that the project stays on track and is completed within budget and on schedule. I feel comfortable in being in this role since I feel confident in managing the process of the ISP. </h3> 
    <h2> Product Manager </h2>
    <h3> A product manager is responsible for defining and delivering a product that meets the needs of the market and the business. This involves conducting market research to identify customer needs and working with cross-functional teams, such as engineering, design, and sales, to bring the product to market. Product managers may also be responsible for setting the product vision and strategy, defining the product roadmap and feature set, and managing the product lifecycle. They may work closely with stakeholders, such as customers, sales teams, and executives, to ensure that the product meets the needs of the market and aligns with the overall business strategy. I feel that I can be a good fit for this role since I am good with researching and communication with those associated with the ISP. </h3>
    <h2> Release Engineer </h2>
    <h3> A release engineer is responsible for the development and management of the processes and tools used to build, test, and deploy software releases. This may involve automating the build, test, and deployment process, setting up and maintaining continuous integration and delivery systems, and working with development teams to ensure that releases are stable and reliable. Release engineers may also be responsible for managing code branching and merging, creating and maintaining documentation related to the release process, and working with other teams to coordinate the release of new features and updates. I believe that I can be a good fit for this role since I can make updated version of our ISP to make it better. </h3>
