  <div class="h1">
    Identity:
    <div class="h2">
      Aerofli is an AI software and robotics company that will produce and modify commercial planes fly with the power of AI. 
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Problem:
    <div class="h2">
      Currently, there is a nationwide pilot shortage, resulting in flight delays and cancellation. This is primaly due to the rapid change of work enviornment pilots have to experience, expensive and demanding time it takes to obtain a pilots license, and lack of time pilots can spend with their family. In fact, the U.S. Air Force is also struggling to recruit pilots to operate their fighter jets. Another factor is also the recent pandemic Covid-19, which made air travelling almost impossible, resulting in many pilots to retire. 
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Solution:
    <div class="h2">
      We want to replace human pilots with AI-powered robots/commercial planes. In fact, today's technology is enough to make this possible. This will not only solve the pilot shortage problem but also help airline companies since it can grant safer flights and reduce delays/rescheduleing. Aerofli will solve these problems in two ways: making robots operate on currently running commercial planes(temporary) and making AI-powered commercial planes(future). 
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Target Market:
    <div class="h2">
      Our target audience is airline companies around the world like Emirates as well as airplane manufacturing comanies like Boeing. As AI is advancing, many airline comapnies would want to adopt to AI powered planes that would help them reduce delay time and grant more safety. Airplane manufacturing companies would want to seek our product since it can help them with air traffic communication, quality control, and in-flight experience.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Competition:
    <div class="h2">
      Currently, there isn't much competition in making AI-powered planes. While large commercial plane companies like Boeing and Airbus are starting to focus on AI, there are only researching the topic rather than making it their main focus.
      
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Revenue Streams:
    <div class="h2">
      AeroFli will have 2 different revenue streams: airline companies that will buy our AI-powered aircrafts and airplane manufacturing companies that will buy our hardware and software.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Marketing Activities:
    <div class="h2">
      AeroFli will first show off their products at airshows to seek airline and aircraft companies. After that, Aerofli will sell accordingly to the audience: with airline companies, AeroFli will sell them aircrafts while with airplane manufacturing comanies, AeroFli will sell either parts of hardware or software depending on what they desire.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Expenses:
    <div class="h2">
      <ul>
	<li>Equipment, tools, and room to build aircrafts and robotic parts</li>
	<li>Employees and workspaces for AI developers</li>
	<li>Space and open fields to test our products</li>
	</ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="h1">
    Team and Key Role:
    <div class="h2">
      Currently, AeroFli has 2 memeber: Omer Erturk as the Cheif in Airlines Sales and Tahmid Rahman as the Cheif in Airplane Manufacturing Sales. In the future when AeroFli does grow, it will hire employees to enable more growth.

    Milestone/GANTT Chart:
    <br> <div class="h2">
      1. Planning Phase: we will go over and research on aerospace and AI.
      2. Dev. Phase: we wil apply our researched and work on our AI and planes.
      3. Finalizing/Testing Phase: we will test our product and choose our final product for selling and manufacturing.
