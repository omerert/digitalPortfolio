    <h1>Fingerprints</h1>
    <p style="line-height:2;">The interent is filled with many useful tools: wikipedias, banking, shopping, etc. However, how would we know that the websites we access are safe? To ensure safety, use websites that have HTTPS at the beginning of their links. HTTPS is a safe connection that uses SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS(Transport Layer Security) and cannot be broken into. However, corporation, schols, and organizations cannot track their clients data through HTTPS. Therefore, private institutions developed HTTPS Proxy Appliances, which enables them to track clients but with the loss of many security features. With HTTPS connection, it helps prefent MITM(man in the middle) attacks. A MITM attack is when a spy/hacker connects beteween a user and an app, allowing them to eavesdrop on the actions a user is doing. This creates the risk of having information stolen like SSN, credit card, etc.  </p>
