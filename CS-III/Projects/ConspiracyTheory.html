      <h2>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
      <p class="indent" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px; ">The recommendation algorithm is present through
        various platforms on
        the internet. It is a system that decides a user's desired content based on their activity on the platform. In
        social media, when a user likes or comments on a post or video within a specific topic, the recommendation
        system will create a feed of more videos similar to those the user has interacted with. For example, if a user
        were to like and comment on various videos related to animals, the algorithm would infer that the user is
        interested in animals. Therefore, the user will receive more videos related to animals based on the inference.
        With this system, the user is more likely to spend more time and engagement on the platform. </p>
      <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
      <p class="indent" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px;">
        With the user surrounded with content based on their interactions, they end up being stuck in the Feedback Loop.
        Since the user will mainly see videos they previously interacted with, many are prone to interacting with more
        extreme or biased opinions of the content they initially engaged with. Over time, it leads to a "filter bubble"
        or "echo chamber" effect, where the user will see content that does not align with their beliefs. </p>
      <h2>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
      <p class="indent" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px;">Conspiracy theories, often driven by emotions and
        sensations, tend to generate high user engagement. They tend to earn immense amounts of attention and views due
        to their outrageous claims, which sparks their popularity. Their popularity only increases through the
        amplification of algorithms, making them a popular topic in the media. Although some of these conspiracy
        theories do advocate for purposeful ideas, the majority of them end up spreading false and sensational
        information. Those who craft conspiracy theories often employ algorithmic amplification to spread false
        information for their own purposes.</p>
      <h2>Platform Incentives</h2>
      <p class="indent" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px;">
        Conspiracy theories occupy a large audience due to their sensational and emotionally engaging nature. They tend
        to attract high levels of user engagement, including clicks, likes, shares, and watch time, owing to their
        dramatic narratives, sensational claims, and emotional appeals. Knowing that recommendation algorithms was
        designed to maximize user engagement, they may inadvertently prioritize and amplify conspiracy theories,
        sometimes without considering the content quality or truthfulness. This emphasis on engagement can cause the
        spread of sensational and falsely-led information. </p>
      <h2>Potential for exploitation</h2>
      <p class="indent" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px;">
        The primary objective for many online platforms is a boost in user engagement, which leads to increased ad
        revenues. Unfortunately, many are willing to sacrifice the quality and accuracy of content just to earn a higher
        ad revenue. Many who create conspiracy theories have the mindset of exploitation. Those who know how these
        algorithms work can intentionally produce and promote misleading content that feeds conspiracy theories,
        exploiting the algorithms' preference for high engagement. Such manipulation will lead to the advocation of
        false information and harm to the innocent.</p>
