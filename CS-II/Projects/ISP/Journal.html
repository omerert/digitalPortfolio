    <h2 style="font-size: 35px"> Technical Challenges </h2>
    <h3>We are struggling to program in XCode since it does not work on the school Macs and a lot of us do not have Apple OS on our computers. Because of this, only a few of us can take the role of the Software Developer Engineer. </h3>

    <h2> Scheduling Challenges </h2>
    <h3>Because of the Snow Week, a lot of our classes are rushing to finish the quarter on time, resuling in a lot of students needing to spend more time in their classes rather than the ISP. </h3>

    <h2 style="font-size: 35px"> Technical Challenges </h2>
    <h3>We are currently deciding on how to approach our ISP. From software language to learning new terms, we are still struggling on how to make our project come to action. </h3>

    <h2> Scheduling Challenges </h2>
    <h3>A lot of us have testing and extracirriculars to deal with. Since the ACT is coming up,  a lot of our group is dedicating their time to prepare for it. As for extracirriculars like clubs and sports, a lot of us are going out-of-town for competition. We are still deciding on how to prepare our ISP with a lot our members working on other priorities.</h3>

    <h3>As of right now, we do not have any issues. However, if any techincal issues do arrive in the future, we will make sure to work as a team and try to resolve the issue as qucikly and efficiently as possible. </h3>

    <h2> Scheduling Challenges </h2>
    <h3>One scheduling challenge that we are experiencing is that our group is split between A and B days. Students in A day get assignments earlier in some weeks and vice versa. To resolve this issue, we will make ure to have a group chat or some sort of communication between the whole team so that we can communicate about the ISP.</h3>

    <h2 style="font-size: 35px"> Technical Challenges </h2>
    <h3>Some technical Challenges that we are facing are how to implement our project into reality. Of course, while we do have our ideas and strategy on how to execute our ISP into reality, it won’t be as easy as it seems. First of all, we need to learn and get proficient with programming in Swift since our ISP will be an app. We need to learn how to program an app, make it visually appealing, work properly, and upload it on the app store. We will need to use a lot of resources to learn how to use all of these technical mechanics. Second of all, a lot of us are used to using Microsoft and programming languages other than Swift. We will have to make a change to get used to Apple and programming in Swift. Those of us that do not have Apple products like iPhone or a Macbook will need to work on another part of the project that does not require them to make a change that will result in them spending money. Even with these barriers, it does not prevent us from succeeding. All of these technical problems do seem overwhelming at first, we as a group will overcome them. We will make sure that we can learn how to proficiently program in Swift and how to create an app in order to succeed.glob</h3>
    <h2> Scheduling Challenges </h2>
    <h3>Some scheduling challenges that we’ve encountered are class loads and extracurricular. Some of our group members take multiple rigorous classes that require them to use up a lot of their time. As a result, they would not have much time to save for the ISP and would be left out because they cannot catch up. Another problem is that our group is split between A and B days. To solve these issues, we can split the ISP so that scheduling issues would rise up.

    <h1> Roles </h1>
    
    <h2> (software) Development Engineer </h2>
    <h3> A software development engineer is responsible for designing, testing, and maintaining software systems that meet the needs of users. They work on various aspects of the software development process, including coding, debugging, and quality assurance. They may also collaborate with other team members, such as project managers, designers, and business analysts, to ensure that the software being developed is effective, efficient, and meets the goals of the project. Ultimately, the primary goal of a software development engineer is to create high-quality software that meets the needs of users and helps organizations achieve their objectives. I might not be the best fit for this role since my understanding of Swift is not the highest. </h3>
    <h2> QA Engineer </h2>
    <h3> A QA, also known as quality assurance, engineer is responsible for ensuring that the software being developed meets the necessary standards of quality: designing and implementing testing procedures, executing tests, and identifying and tracking defects. QA engineers work closely with software development engineers to identify and resolve defects and improve the overall quality of the software. They may also be responsible for creating and maintaining documentation related to the testing process, such as test plans and bug reports. I might be a good fit for this role since, in my own projects, I am able to identify how I can make my project better by running realistic test. </h3>
    <h2> Project Manager </h2>
    <h3> A project manager is responsible for:  planning, organizing, and directing the work of a team to achieve a specific goal. This includes establishing project goals and objectives, creating project plans, and defining roles and responsibilities for team members. Project managers also play a key role in budgeting and resource allocation, and may be responsible for tracking and reporting on project progress to stakeholders. They may work with a variety of team members, including developers, designers, and business analysts, to ensure that the project stays on track and is completed within budget and on schedule. I feel comfortable in being in this role since I feel confident in managing the process of the ISP. </h3> 
    <h2> Product Manager </h2>
    <h3> A product manager is responsible for defining and delivering a product that meets the needs of the market and the business. This involves conducting market research to identify customer needs and working with cross-functional teams, such as engineering, design, and sales, to bring the product to market. Product managers may also be responsible for setting the product vision and strategy, defining the product roadmap and feature set, and managing the product lifecycle. They may work closely with stakeholders, such as customers, sales teams, and executives, to ensure that the product meets the needs of the market and aligns with the overall business strategy. I feel that I can be a good fit for this role since I am good with researching and communication with those associated with the ISP. </h3>
    <h2> Release Engineer </h2>
    <h3> A release engineer is responsible for the development and management of the processes and tools used to build, test, and deploy software releases. This may involve automating the build, test, and deployment process, setting up and maintaining continuous integration and delivery systems, and working with development teams to ensure that releases are stable and reliable. Release engineers may also be responsible for managing code branching and merging, creating and maintaining documentation related to the release process, and working with other teams to coordinate the release of new features and updates. I believe that I can be a good fit for this role since I can make updated version of our ISP to make it better. </h3>
