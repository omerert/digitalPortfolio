   The Cafe Project
  </h1>
  <h2>Concept:</h2>
  <h3>The Cafe Project ultimately serves to develop a technology-based system/app in which students can pre-order lunches securely, then pick up their desired food at the location which they select. This way, lunch lines would move much faster: only id   entity would need to be provided at the physical location, then food would be almost instantly received.</h3>
  <h2> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> The Cafe Project </a></h2>
  
  <h2>Decision:</h2>
  <h3 class="h3">We decided not to join this group for two reasons: unrealistic scenario and technology issues. I belive that this idea is unrealistic in that if everyone preorders  their food, there will still be a line. It will take around the same time or if not longer to buy your food directly from the lunchline than to preorder, show your order to the worker, and get your food. Not only that but there are hundreds of students buying lunch at the same time, meaning that no matter what method is used there wil still be a line. This idea will also suffer technological issues. There will be hundreds of students preordering their food at the same time, which could result in servers to be slow or even crash. Not only that but the workers at the lunchline would need to spend time to learn how to operate the project. I feel that the way the lunch lines operate right now is the most effective method. </h3>
  
  <h1> The City Planner </h1>
  <h2> Concept: </h2>
  <h3>Our app, the City Planner, is a community-organization service. It has community leaders create event planning sheets. It was created mostly due to the lack of togetherness that most cities and towns suffer from. Users can filter and select city events that want to atttend, and get notified when it is about to begin. </h3>
  <h2> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/benjamin-haines/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> The City Planner</a> </h2>
  <h2> Decision: </h2>
  <h3> We decided not to choose this idea due to lack of location and expensive to run. While this business idea is solid when it comes to bringing people together, it lacks widespread to other locations. Since there are community leaders for each city, it would be near immposible to have them for each city. Not only that but this would be very expensive to run. Again, having community leaders for each city and town would be very costly yet alone for each genre of events. It would also be expensive in finding each and every event in each and every city and town. Overall, having community leaders for each city and town and even the lack of interest might make this business idea unsuccessful.</h3>
      
  <h1> Code Converter</h1>
  <h2> Concept: </h2>
  <h3> There are many different coding languages in the world, each with different syntax and speed. Our product will create an app that converts slower and easier languages to faster and harder languages, which can be time consuming by hand. The code converter will use a file type or txt file of the code and convert the syntax from one language to another. For our first languages, we will be trying to convert Swift to C++.</h3>
  <h2> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-ye/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/considered.html">  Code Converter</a></h2>
  <h2> Decision: </h2>
  <h3> We decided not to choose this business idea for pre-existing applications and lack of content. While code conversion is a very useful tool for programmers, this idea existed a while back. In fact, code converters line Code Beautify already does this job but with many other languages line Python to C++. Not only that but I feel that this business idea does lack in terms of content. I don't feel confident in a business idea that only converts from Swift to C++. Although making a code convertor is a difficult job, due to pre-existing applications and lack of content, I don't see the success in this business proposal. </h3>

  <h1> Automated Plantation </h1>
  <h2> Concept: </h2>
  <h3> The idea for my ISP is an automated garden, taking multiple environmental factors into account such as sunlight, humidity, etc. and automatically adjusting to always provide and optimal environment for the plants to grow. A Raspberry Pi will be used as the main computer in our ISP, using weather APIs and various sensors to determine the environmental conditions of the garden. The Raspberry Pi will then adjust (e.g., more artifical light in the absence of sunlight, more water pumped into the plants in absence of humidity, etc.) and allow for the plants to thrive.</h3>
  <h2> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Automated Garden </a> </h2>
  <h2> Decision: </h2>
        <h3>We chose not to join this group since hard to execute and high chance of failure. Having a robot taking care of a plant properly is very difficult to execute. The robot has to make sure to not harm it in anyway and to run 24/7 just to care for the plant. Not only that but there is also a chance of the Raspberry suddenly not working is also high. Heavy rain, hailing, tornados, and even hurricanes are just some factors that could completely wipe out the circut boards and mechanical parts of the automated farming. There is also rusting and wildlife that could interfere with the automated farm that could result it to stop working or even not working proeprly. </h3> 
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.htm">A Social Media Bot </a>  </h1>


	<h2> Decision: </h2>
	<h3>The overall idea has the potential to do very well due to it being categorized under social media. The issue with this is that many big names in social media have also implemented this into their apps, thus making it a competitive market. Originality is crucial for the marketability aspect. The idea could also be a privacy hazard due to it requiring personal data. Because of this weakness, many will avoid using this bot and therefore could result in an unsuccessful business idea.  </h3>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/faraz-piracha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Foob</a></h1>


	<h2> Decision: </h2>
	<h3>I like this idea because it tackles a real problem people face daily. However, there are many apps like the one above which can make it hard to compete with others. Their resources could be more extensive in regard to their overall potential for marketing. Not only that but this business idea is a little too simplistic and could maybe provide more features. Some, for example, could be a diet program, food preferences, muscle building, etc.</h3>

	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/layne-yarbrough/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Eagle Eats </a>  </h1>


	<h2> Decision: </h2>
	<h3>The overall idea is innovative and is a potential solution faced at our school. The downside involved with this would be the logistics. Students would still be going in line to get food which would be counterintuitive. Even when students do preorder their food, it will take the same amount or even more time to receive their food. This is due to employees needing to receive the order, prepare it, and distribute it to the student. It is a more tedious task to do than ordering in-person. </h3>
	<h1><a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">TV360
	</a>  </h1>


	<h2> Decision: </h2>
	<h3>This idea would be ineffective and would serve no purpose whatsoever. A person watching tv would already be in a stationary position and therefore there is no need for the tv to move. The individual could manually turn the TV which counteracts the purpose of the TV. The costs would also be very high for this startup without taking into consideration the trial and error process involved. Not only that but the demand for this product would be very low due to the uninterest in 360 tvs and the overall expensive cost to manufacture and ship.
	</h3>
	<h1><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Dx3
	</a>  </h1>


	<h2> Decision: </h2>
	<h3>While this business idea does have the potential in keeping people awake and even save lives, I believe that it is hard to execute and even a safety hazard. While this idea does promise to keep its clients awake, it does need many mechanisms to follow the client's face. Not only that but if the client is driving and the Dx3 goes off with a siren or an air horn, it could scare the client and result in them panicking while driving. Another weakness of this innovation is that if the size is too big, it wouldn't be portable enough for the client to take it to work, school, car, etc.  </h3>
	<h1>Smartshop</h1>
  <h2>Concept:</h2>
  <h3>Smartshop is a filtering system for people to be able to purchase clothes depending on their physiological needs, personal preferences, and current trends. This filtering system would be hosted on a public website or an app.</h3>
  <h2> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/avanish-jeendru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html"> Smartshop </a> </h2>
  <h2>Decision:</h2>
  <h3> We accepted this business idea since it followed current events and could be helpful for many communites. This idea pormises to filter based on current trends. This could attract audiences like teenagers and college students. Not only that but it is also helpful for many communities. Many people feel insecure about how they dress and how they might look as a result of how they dress. This filtering project could help be supportive based of of their physiological needs and insecurities.  </h3>
