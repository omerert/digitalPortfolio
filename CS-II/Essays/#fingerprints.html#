    <div class="p">The internet has many useful tools: Wikipedias, banking, shopping, etc. However, the internet also has virus, false news, and data-stealing software. To ensure safety, use websites that contain HTTPS at the beginning of their links. HTTPS is a safe connection that uses "SSL or TLS (Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security)" and cannot be intercepted(Gibson 4). However, corporations, schools, and organizations cannot track their clients data through HTTPS. Therefore, private institutions developed HTTPS Proxy Appliances, which enables them to track clients but with the loss of many security features. HTTPS connection ensures to prevent any MITM(man in the middle) attacks. A MITM attack is when a spy/hacker connects between a user and an app, allowing them to eavesdrop on the actions a user is doing. This creates the risk of having information stolen like SSN, credit card, etc. A hash or a cryptographic hash is a complex algorithm that precisely processes every bit. a good hash cannot be easily accessible to an attacker. Certificate Authorities(CA) are entities that, once proven to exist, digitally sign the sites security certificate. This helps sites to prove their credibility through the internet. Changing back, HTTPS Proxy Appliance is known as SSL Interception. SSL Interception makes sure to check traffic and determine whether to intercept, block, or allow it. While it cannot be prevented, it can be detected. By checking the websites certificate information, you can determine if SSL Interception is taking place or not. Connecting to website security, a false-positive is when a security scanner detects a vulnerability on the website you are on. A false-negative is the opposite. If I am using my school servers, they are allowed to eavesdrop on my conversations since I am using their service and agreed to them.
